The Kepler space telescope was NASA’s first planet-hunting mission, assigned to search a portion of the Milky Way galaxy for Earth-sized planets orbiting stars outside our solar system.During nine years
in deep space Kepler, and its second act, the extended mission dubbed K2, showed our galaxy contains billions of hidden "exoplanets," many of which could be promising places for life.They proved that 
our night sky is filled with more planets even than stars–knowledge that revolutionizes understanding of our place in the cosmos.
